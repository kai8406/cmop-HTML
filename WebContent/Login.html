				<h2>优点1</h2>
				<p>The best part about forms in Bootstrap is that all your
					inputs and controls look great no matter how you build them in your
					markup. No superfluous HTML is required, but we provide the
					patterns for those who require it.</p>
				<p>More complicated layouts come with succinct and scalable
					classes for easy styling and event binding, so you're covered at
					every step.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span4">
				<h2>优点2</h2>
				<p>Bootstrap comes with support for four types of form layouts:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Vertical (default)</li>
					<li>Search</li>
					<li>Inline</li>
					<li>Horizontal</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Different types of form layouts require some changes to
					markup, but the controls themselves remain and behave the same.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span4">
				<h2>优点3</h2>
				<p>Bootstrap's forms include styles for all the base form
					controls like input, textarea, and select you'd expect. But it also
					comes with a number of custom components like appended and
					prepended inputs and support for lists of checkboxes.</p>
				<p>States like error, warning, and success are included for each
					type of form control. Also included are styles for disabled
					controls.</p>
